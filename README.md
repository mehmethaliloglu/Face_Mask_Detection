# Face Mask Detection

This project uses the Deep Neural Network to distinguish between images of masked and unmasked people. The meaning of each line of code is explained as a comment line. Whether you export a video or capture images from your own camera, both will produce accurate results. I tried it on a video in the project and you can see the results in the 'Videos taken for testing' folder. If you want to use your own camera, it says what to do in .py files as a comment line.
